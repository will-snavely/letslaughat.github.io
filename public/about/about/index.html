&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Laugh At&rdquo; is a recurring comedy show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
We bring various goofs, gaffs and pranks to stages around the city.
Do you read &ldquo;The Family Circus&rdquo; or &ldquo;Marmaduke&rdquo; in the paper? This is kind
of like that, but on a stage, live. If you like laughing, please check out
our events and shows.
Here&rsquo;s an example of a joke you might experience at one of our events.
Two people walk on stage. The first person asks, &ldquo;When is the bus coming?&rdquo;
The second person replies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the bus,&rdquo; and turns into a bus. The
bus (who was a person just a moment ago) drives away. The first person
(who is still a person) considers the situation and says, &ldquo;That was a
strange yet funny event.&rdquo;">
