"Let's Laugh At" is a recurring comedy show in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
We bring various goofs, gaffs and pranks to stages around the city.
Do you read "The Family Circus" or "Marmaduke" in the paper? This is kind
of like that, but on a stage, live. If you like laughing, please check out
our events and shows. 

Here's an example of a joke you might experience at one of our events.
Two people walk on stage. The first person asks, "When is the bus coming?"
The second person replies, "I'm the bus," and turns into a bus. The
bus (who was a person just a moment ago) drives away. The first person
(who is still a person) considers the situation and says, "That was a
strange yet funny event."
